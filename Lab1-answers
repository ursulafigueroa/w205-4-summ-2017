##Submissions:

    Provide a screenshot of the running UCB AMI that shows you have successfully launched an EC2 instance using the UCB AMI (ISVC).
    
    Provide the answers to the following questions in a file called Lab1-answers.txt

    Q1: What is the difference between EBS and S3?
    
    Amazon S3 and Amazon EBS are different types of storage. Amazon S3 is a web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve 
    any amount of data from anywhere to the web, while Amazon EBS is a block level storage, which is only accessible to EC2 instances (One instance may access more than one EBS).
    
    As compared to Amazon EBS, the process of requesting an object in Amazon S3 is slower, but it is a highly scalable storage service.
    There are very little chances to lose data or reach maximum storage capacity. It’s better to use it to store and deliver objects
    that don’t require a lot of read/write operations, like backups. Amazon EBS stores data as blocks of the same size and organizes them 
    through the hierarchy similar to a traditional file system. 
     
    Q2: When would you consider a cloud infrastructure for your data science tasks?
    When working in collaborative environments and if available computing resources are not enough.

    Q3: What is the difference between spot instances and reserved instances?
    
    Reserved instances allow the user to use the compute by hour without requiring long term commitment. 
    Spot instances are a bid for low price version of reserved instances, but could be shut down by AWS anytime the Spot instance price 
    goes higher than bid price. 
    Spot price fluctuates based on the supply and demand of the capacity. 
    It's essentially the leftover capacity of AWS to be used. 

    Q4: List the names of four software packages installed on the UCB AMI
