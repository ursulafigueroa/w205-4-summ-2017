Question 3: What similarities do you see in the explain plains for these 3 queries?  

To make the selection (filter), in all of them a Seq Scan is performed over the table where the query will be performed.

Question 4: What is the difference between the plans for the Partitioned table and the union query?
Why do you think this difference exists? In the first case two tables containing only 201701 and 201702 payments records are united.
In the second case, a general payments table is filtered. From both customer_id and amount are displayed by customer_id.

In total, the union query plan has one row less than the partition; with one more aggregation row (1 for each table),
but one less Seq Scan and Filter, given that the partition runs a Seq scan for payment, payment2007_01 and payment2007_02.

Question 5: What join algorithm is used for the inner join?

Hash Join.
