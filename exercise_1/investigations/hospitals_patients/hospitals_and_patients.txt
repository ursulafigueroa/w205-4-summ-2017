Average scores for hospital quality and patient survey responses correlation

In order to correlate average scores for hopsital quality and patient survey responses, we need to get this data from Timely and Effective Care and HCAHPS transformed tables.

We proceed to join both tables by Provider ID field and establish a correlation between scores and survey results. Then we estimate the correlation with the following formula: AVG(A*B)-AVG(A)*AVG(B)/STDEV(A)STDEV(B)

(Avg(HCAHPS_Answer_Percent_AVG * Hospital_Score_AVG) - Avg(HCAHPS_Answer_Percent_AVG) * Avg(Hospital_Score_AVG)) / (STDDEV(HCAHPS_Answer_Percent_AVG) * STDDEV(Hospital_Score_AVG))

The result is 0.4292401798914775

Procedural variability and patient survey responses correlation.

In order find the correlation beteween both variables (for hopsital quality and patient survey responses), we need to get this data from Timely and Effective Care and HCAHPS transformed tables.

We proceed to join both tables by Provider ID field and establish a correlation between scores and survey results. Then we estimate the correlation with the following formula: AVG(A*B)-AVG(A)*AVG(B)/STDEV(A)STDEV(B)

The result is 0.4447074320316066
